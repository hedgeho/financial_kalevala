# 🔱 The Tales of Kalevala: Financial Wisdom

A terminal-based interactive story game teaching financial literacy through Finnish mythology and three unique companion perspectives.

## 🎮 About

You are a young hero in the ancient lands of Kalevala, traveling with three companions who each embody different financial philosophies. Through your adventures, you'll face decisions that test not just your courage, but your financial wisdom—while your companions debate, advise, and react to every choice you make.

### Your Three Companions

**Aino the Careful** (Cautious Spender)
```
  (•‿•)
 <|   |>
  /‾‾‾\
```
*Soft blue shawl like ripples of a lake, silver birch-leaf brooch*

Thoughtful and soft-spoken, Aino always considers the long winter ahead. She collects small savings, keeps ledgers, and dislikes taking risks without reason. She represents prudence, planning, and long-term thinking.

> "Silver saved today is warmth earned tomorrow."

**Ilmarinen the Forgemind** (Balanced Analyst)
```
 [◉_◉]
 <|─┬─|>
   / \
```
*Dark forge apron with glowing runes, copper spectacles*

Calm, rational, and methodical—Ilmarinen sees finances as he sees metalwork: measure twice, strike once. He represents investigation, craft, and critical thinking. He'll test any claim before trusting it.

> "Even gold must be tested before trusted."

**Lemminkäinen the Bold** (Risk-Taker)
```
  (⌐■_■)
  <|  ^)>
   /🔥\
```
*Fiery red cloak flowing like a fox's tail, belt full of trinkets*

Dashing, charming, and reckless, Lemminkäinen lives for excitement. He represents FOMO, spontaneous spending, and "fortune favors the brave" energy. His enthusiasm is infectious—but not always wise.

> "Luck won't wait—so why should we?"

### Current Scenario: "The Shimmering Belt of Louhi"

Your group encounters a merchant selling magical belts with manufactured urgency and social pressure. Each companion reacts according to their philosophy:

- **Lemminkäinen** wants to buy immediately—this is too good to miss!
- **Aino** urges caution—that's almost all your silver
- **Ilmarinen** offers to investigate—let's verify before deciding

**Your choice will:**
- Affect how each companion views you (hidden approval system)
- Lead to different outcomes and lessons
- Generate unique reactions from all three perspectives
- Teach real financial literacy concepts

## 🎯 Educational Goals

This game teaches teenagers essential financial concepts through character-driven narrative:

1. **FOMO & Impulse Control** - Resisting pressure to make quick decisions
2. **Due Diligence** - Questioning too-good-to-be-true offers and seeking verification
3. **Social Pressure Resistance** - Making decisions based on personal values, not peer pressure
4. **Opportunity Cost** - Understanding what you give up when you spend money
5. **Critical Thinking** - Recognizing manipulation tactics (urgency, scarcity, social proof)
6. **Multiple Perspectives** - Understanding that different financial philosophies have value

## 🚀 How to Play

```bash
python3 kalevala_game.py
```

Or make it executable and run directly:
```bash
chmod +x kalevala_game.py
./kalevala_game.py
```

## 💡 How the Companion System Works

### Active Advisors Throughout
Your three companions actively debate with each other and react to your decisions in real-time:
- They chime in during merchant pitches
- They argue about the best course of action
- They react emotionally to your choices
- They reflect on outcomes from their unique perspectives

### Hidden Approval System
Each companion tracks their opinion of your choices, but this is never shown numerically:
- Choose impulsively → Lemminkäinen approves, Aino worries
- Choose investigation → Ilmarinen approves, Lemminkäinen frustrated
- Choose caution → Aino proud, everyone respects restraint

Approval affects tone, dialogue, and willingness to help—but you learn by observing their reactions, not by watching meters.

### Multi-Perspective Reflections
After each scenario, all three companions share their wisdom:
- Each views the same event through their financial philosophy
- Lemminkäinen learns about the trap of excitement
- Aino emphasizes security and planning
- Ilmarinen explains manipulation tactics
- Together they show the full picture of financial wisdom

## 🎮 Design Philosophy

### Companion Personalities as Teaching Tools
Each companion embodies a real financial mindset:
- **Aino**: People who prioritize security and fear loss
- **Ilmarinen**: People who research and verify before committing
- **Lemminkäinen**: People drawn to excitement and "opportunities"

Teenagers see themselves in these characters and learn that all perspectives have value—but some serve you better in specific situations.

### Learning Through Character
Instead of lecturing, the game teaches through:
- Observing companions react to pressure
- Seeing excitement turn to regret
- Watching skepticism prove correct
- Experiencing the consequences of choices

### Respect for Player Agency
- No judgment for "wrong" choices
- Every path includes valuable lessons
- Companions offer advice but never force decisions
- Hidden approval means authentic reactions, not score-chasing

## 🔮 Future Scenarios

Potential additions:
- **Debt & Borrowing**: Lemminkäinen's reckless loan, Aino's warning, Ilmarinen's terms analysis
- **Investment & Risk**: Different companions advocate for different risk levels
- **Savings & Delayed Gratification**: Choosing between immediate pleasure and future security
- **Value vs. Price**: Understanding quality beyond cost
- **Scam Recognition**: More complex deceptions requiring companion collaboration

## 🌟 Why Three Companions?

Three voices create **internal tension** that mirrors real decision-making:
- The excitement of opportunity (Lemminkäinen)
- The anxiety of risk (Aino)
- The voice of reason (Ilmarinen)

Players learn to balance these voices—just as they must in real financial decisions. Sometimes bold moves pay off. Sometimes caution saves you. Often, investigation reveals truth.

**The wisdom is in listening to all three.**
